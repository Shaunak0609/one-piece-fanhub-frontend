    <p>Kizaru is a Marine Admiral known for his calm and carefree demeanor, 
       yet his power is terrifying — granted by the Glint-Glint Fruit, which allows him to move and attack at light speed. 
       His laziness contrasts his deadly potential, making him an unpredictable force of the Marines.</p>
